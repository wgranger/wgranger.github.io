<p> 
Rails. </p>

<p>I hear it all the time when talking with more experienced programmers, but I’m still unsure what this means after two months of programming. I’m learning Ruby, but what is the difference if it’s “on rails?”</p>

<p>Ruby on Rails allows you to build the back end of websites fast. You’ve probably visited a website today that was made on Rails. Airbnb, Hulu, and Github are just a few examples of sites that were created using Ruby on Rails. With the amount of startups that are popping up, more and more companies will need websites made quickly, and Ruby on Rails is often the answer.</p>

<p>Ruby on Rails makes certain assumptions about what you need to build a website from the moment you begin a new project. When you create a new project using Rails, you begin with a number of files already created for you. This makes your life easier, allowing you to write less code while accomplishing more in the process. However, it’s important to remember that Rails is a framework that is written in Ruby. It is not a different coding language.</p>

<p>More specifically, Rails is a Model-View-Controller framework. The best way that I understand the model-view-controller is that is governs the way the user interacts with the front and back end of a website or application. The user will manipulate a controller which will in turn change how the model processes data. That model will then push the changes to the view, which is what the user sees. I think of it as so:</p>

<p>
<pre>
Model: Stores and retrieves data in the system
View: Output presented to the user
Controller: An instrument the user utilizes to manipulate the model
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Aside from this, Ruby on Rails also uses the DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principal that is so important to Ruby. Even though Rails is a framework, the philosophy and ideas of Ruby still remain.
