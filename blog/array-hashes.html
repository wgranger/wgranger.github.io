  <h2>Arrays vs Hashes</h2>
  <h4>October 25, 2015</h4>

	<p>Data - lots of it. One of the first things you learn when working through Ruby is that you can store collections of data through <strong>arrays</strong> or <strong>hashes</strong>. Arrays and hashes are like brother two siblings, one is just a bit more complex and mature than the other, and you're going to be using these siblings to help you store lists of information and categories while writing programs.</p>

	<p>Does some of your data contain different categories? <strong>Hashes</strong> are what you are looking for.</p>

	<p>Do you need to keep your data in order? Then <strong>arrays </strong>are what you're looking for.</p>

	<p>Understanding the difference between arrays and hashes can be easy, but mastering them will take a bit of work. Simply put, an array is used for keeping track of a one-dimensional list of data. Each item in an array by default has a number associated to a position in the array. Let's take a look at an example.</p>

	<code>
		bands = [Creedence Clearwater Revival, Thin Lizzy, Fugazi]
	</code>

	<p>In the example above, our array <code>bands</code> has three elements. Creedence Clearwater Revival has the default index of 0. Thin Lizzy has a default index of 1, and Fugazi has a default index of 2. This array will retain this order as is the nature of arrays.</p>

	<p>Hashes are much more powerful in that they replace that default integer index with a key-value system. We can now store data in certain categories to make them more dynamic. Check out this code for an example.</p>

	<code>menu = {"guacamole" => 4, "taco" => 3, "burrito" => 7 }</code>

	<p>In the example above, the hash <code>menu</code> contains three key-value pairs. The guacamole key has a value of four, the taco key has a value of three, and the burrito key has a value of seven. </p>

	<p>Understanding the difference between arrays and hashes is the first step. Their differences are evident, but mastering all their peculiarities in depth takes a bit of practice. By working through some beginning Ruby programming, the syntax of arrays and hashes will become more natural and their real potential will be realized.</p>
