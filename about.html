<h3>WILL GRANGER</h3>
<p>
I'm originally from Birmingham, AL, but have had the opportunity to travel throughout the US as a touring musician and see the world as a Peace Corps volunteer. In the past I have split my time between music, as a teacher, musician, and manager at a music venue, and education, as an English teacher in primary and secondary schools in the US and universities abroad. I've also spent time as a writer: both academic writing for grants and colloquial writing for articles and blogs.</p>
<p>
I am a ravenous consumer of music. If there's an artist I don't know, I'll often spend my day working through that artist's discography - wheter it is Romanian gypsy, Nigerian Afrobeat, or No Wave from New York. Aside from music, I try to keep up my hobby of understanding and building circuits using capacitors, transistors, and resistors. I recently developed a love for two-wheeled vehicles after purchasing a scooter. I love opening up the scooter's engine to understand how it works and learning if I need to adjust the valves, replace the clutch cable, or troubleshoot a lingering problem. I hope my knowledge of mechanics grows to one day rebuilding a salvaged motorcycle.</p>
<p>
I hate lines and waiting, which is odd considering I'm a patient person. Although I could wait in the lobby for a doctor for an hour reading pamphlets without breaking a sweat, it's the traffic lines and rows of people waiting for food that I tend to avoid. If I'm ever stuck in traffic, I'll often change my direction and take a much longer route simply so I'm not sitting in traffic and staring at the car in front of me.</p>
