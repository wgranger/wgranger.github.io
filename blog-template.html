How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

Our pair worked through this challenge without much difficulty, but I noticed how many different ways you can do things with HTML. For example, when making a list of things in HTML we discussed putting a list tag into our HTML, adding a table, or even putting in a list of <p> tags. Since there are so many different ways to compose code in HTML, we often had to discuss the pros and cons of using certain tags rather than others.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

Wireframing definitely helped because we had a point of reference when working through our website. We weren't able to get too complicated with our wireframing design due to our limited HTML skills, but it was nice to talk through our creative process when thinking about a website design. 

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?

We discussed this idea briefly and determined a good wireframe was something that covered all elements of the website layout. A good layout will already determine what should be included in the site and will left nothing open to question. 

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

I didn't learn any new elements throughout this activity, especially since we were restricted from styling our website. However, this is the most I have ever commented on an HTML document, and I am curious just how much commenting I will be doing once I begin coding. It seems that commenting is a good practice to get into.
