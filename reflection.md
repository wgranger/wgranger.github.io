What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

I actually didn't use these elements too much in my site. Thinking about it now, I probably could've solved a good bit of positioning problems if I had used these elements. However, I did use padding to keep my body paragraphs from hiding under the footer at the end of the page. I'll look to using these elements more to solve layout problems in the future that are sure to occur.

What did you learn about CSS positioning?

I learned that things don't always work the way you expect them to. I couldn't always get things to display just the way I wanted them to and I often got confused between the position and display tags. I also learned that placing items in the same parent tag works sometimes, but other times doesn't really do much. I'm still not having much luck with the inline display, so maybe I need to do more researching on that, because I'm sure there's something in my code that is restricting this property from working. I used the position element a good bit, but I am often searching for the best way to get items to fit just the way I want them. I don't trust using pixels or em's because I feel like my content won't appear right on other browsers. I have been using percentages with occassional success.

What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

Type was incredibly easy to change. I had to difficulties changing the size, type, or weight of any font on my page. The biggest difficulty was getting items inline (which I wasn't quite able to do just how I wanted) and making sure things fit just right on the browser. I was quite satisfied with how the header and footer eventually turned out, but I kind of threw in the navigation bar on the left at the last minute and abandoned my layout on it when I couldn't get it to fit on the screen just how I wanted.

What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

I wonder if I relied on CSS a bit too much. I'd be curious to see what my cohort-mates' CSS looks like. I wouldn't say my CSS code is clean, and I often just throw things into my CSS until it works the way I want it to (in hopes of keeping my HTML clean). I feel kind of like a kid pushing all of my clutter under my bed (the bed being CSS). Once all the output on the webpage looks good, I'm not really concerned with how it looks under the bed, even though things could get broken and overlap each other.
